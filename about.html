                    I am a Junior at Castle High School and I will be graduating in May 2025. 
                    I have been doing programming for about 2 years now but have been
                    interested in technology for my whole life. I have played many sports
                    throughout my life but my favorite is basketball. I enjoy many things 
                    but family is always my first priority. I believe family is the most 
                    important thing in life after God.

                    I plan on attending the University of Evansville and double majoring in Computer Science but I am still 
                    undecided on the second major. I also have a great oppurunity this summer with an internship at NexTech. They are a great company offering teachings of html and css. I cannot wait to start that and learn so much more and make some wonderful connections that could help me get another internship or even a job.
